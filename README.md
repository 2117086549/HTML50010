==========================

HTML5/Javascript web browser game. Entry to GitHub [game-off-2012](https://github.com/github/game-off-2012) challenge.

You are a hungry (ninja) rabbit whose goal is to **pull** as much carrots 
as possible from farmers grounds in **5 minutes**. There is, however, competition!
Other hungry rabbits will try to outrun you and get the carrots for themselves, so you must "fight"  them.
Your weapons are slightly unorthodox. Simply uhm ... fart to **push** your competition away or use a **fork-totem** 
decoy to deceive opponents.

_*For some reason when played on Windows 2008R2 Server the game runned somehow choppy._

# Controls
